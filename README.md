Face Detection and Recognition System 🧑🔍

A customizable face recognition tool that identifies individuals in images using Python’s powerful libraries. Enhance it with your own database of faces and let it detect and annotate matches seamlessly!

⭐ Don't forget to star this repository if you find it useful!

Introduction 🌟

Welcome to a flexible face recognition system that helps you detect and identify people in photographs based on a user-created image database. Built with Python and popular libraries like face_recognition and opencv, this system is both accurate and user-friendly. Simply populate the database with images of individuals and let the system find matches quickly and efficiently.

Features 🚀

✔ Face Detection – Uses Haar Cascade classifiers to find faces in images. 🔎
✔ Face Recognition – Matches detected faces with your custom database. 👤
✔ Annotation – Highlights recognized faces with labeled rectangles. 🏷️
✔ Scalability – Built to support future enhancements like video file processing. 📈

Installation 💻

Make sure Python is installed on your machine, then set up the required libraries:

pip install face_recognition opencv-python


Clone this repository with:

git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/face-recognition-system.git

Usage 📘

Create a database folder with images of individuals.

Run the script.

Select an image using the file dialog.

The system will detect faces, recognize individuals, and annotate them.

The final output will be saved as result.jpg.

Running the Script ▶️

Navigate to the project directory and execute:

python main.py

Database Structure 🗂️

✔ Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tiff, .bmp, .gif
✔ Each image must contain only one person’s face
✔ Image filename should match the individual’s name (e.g., john_doe.jpg)

Output 🖼️

The annotated image will be saved as result.jpg in the project folder, with rectangles and names highlighting recognized faces.
